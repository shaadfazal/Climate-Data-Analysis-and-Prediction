# Climate Data Analysis and Prediction

## Objective
Analyze the "Global Weather Repository.csv" dataset to forecast future weather trends and showcase data science skills through both basic and advanced techniques. This dataset provides daily weather information for cities around the world and includes over 40 features.

## Dataset
The dataset is available on the Kaggle website:
[World Weather Repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-weather-repository/code)

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding climate patterns and trends.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outliers, normalization, and encoding categorical features.
- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - XGBoost
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
  - Linear Regression
  - Voting Regressor (ensemble model)
- **Model Evaluation:** RMSE, MAE, and R² score calculations.
- **SHAP Analysis:** Understanding model predictions and feature importance.
- **Spatial Analysis:** Visualizing and analyzing geographical weather patterns.
- **Environmental Impact:** Studying air quality and its correlation with weather conditions.

## Basic Approach
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, outliers, and normalize data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform basic EDA to uncover trends, correlations, and patterns.
- **Visualizations:** Generate visualizations for temperature and precipitation trends.
- **Model Building:** Build a basic forecasting model using the `lastupdated` feature for time series analysis and evaluate its performance using different metrics.

## Advanced Approach
- **Advanced EDA:** Implement anomaly detection to identify and analyze outliers.
- **Forecasting with Multiple Models:**
  - Build and compare multiple forecasting models.
  - Create an ensemble of models to improve forecast accuracy.
- **Unique Analyses:**
  - **Climate Analysis:** Study long-term climate patterns and variations in different regions.
  - **Environmental Impact:** Analyze air quality and its correlation with various weather parameters.
  - **Feature Importance:** Apply different techniques to assess feature importance.
  - **Spatial Analysis:** Analyze and visualize geographical patterns in the data.
  - **Geographical Patterns:** Explore how weather conditions differ across countries and continents.


## Results
The models are evaluated using standard regression metrics:
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **R² Score**

SHAP analysis is also conducted to interpret feature importance and understand the impact of different variables on climate predictions.
